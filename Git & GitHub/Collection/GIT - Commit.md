>[!info] Atomic Commits
>Atomic commits are a way to make sure that each commit is a self-contained unit of work. This means that if one commit fails, you can always go back to a previous commit and fix the issue. This is important for maintaining a clean and organized history in your repository.
>- Keep commits centric to one feature, one component, or on fix.
>- Focused on one thing.
