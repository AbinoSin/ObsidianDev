```bash
git status # Check status
```
- First check is there already a REPO?
- Because there is a small chances of being everything overwritten.

---
```bash
git init # Initialize Git (only once per project)
```
- This command will make that folder into REPO!

>[!fail] Git Ignore
>If you do not want some files to be tracked than create a file named `.gitignore` in the same folder where `.git` folder exists and name all the files inside that `.gitignore` file so the git will not track them.

>[!done] Git keep
>Git do not track empty folders thats why inside of empty folder make a file name `.gitkeep` than git will track that folder aswell
